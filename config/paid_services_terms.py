            "We use third-party payment processors to transmit payments to us. By providing a payment method to us, you agree that (i) you have the legal right to use the payment method you provide; (ii) you will in fact pay for the paid service by the date on which payment is due; (iii) the payment information you provide is true and accurate; (iv) we may retain the payment information and method that you and the issuer of your payment method or the applicable payment network submit to us; and (v) you authorise us to charge you for the paid service using any payment methods associated with your Adzsend account (including any updated payment methods(s)). This authorisation for us to charge you for the paid service includes any obligation you may have to pay any taxes applicable to the service you are buying. You also agree that we have permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and our payment processors (including any institutions or processors we retain in the future) information regarding your purchase and your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase and to use the contact information (such as an email address or phone number) submitted by you to provide you with notices and disclosures relating to renewals, recurring charges and changes affecting your purchase.",

            "If a stated price or other material information is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the subscription at that price and reserve the right to cancel, terminate or not process your order (including accepted orders). We will notify you of the error and either provide you with a refund or give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.",

Invoices will be sent to the email address associated with your account and we will invoice you no more than forty-five (45) days after the purchase of the relevant service. All amounts invoiced are due and payable within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice, unless otherwise specified on the invoice itself.

            "Subscriptions purchased through Adzsend and associated subscription fees are available through the 'Billing' section of the Settings page in your Adzsend account. You will find details about the subscriptions you've purchased from Discord, the applicable subscription fee and the next payment due date there as well.",

            "By purchasing a recurring subscription, you acknowledge and agree that you are subscribing to an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments. You'll be automatically charged at the then-current rates when you first purchase your subscription or when your free trial ends if you do not cancel before then, and on each periodic renewal date set out in your Adzsend account (monthly, annually or other renewal period) until cancellation (see 'Cancellation' below for more information on how to cancel a subscription). By enrolling in an automatically recurring subscription, you authorise us or our vendor to charge your payment method for recurring subscription fees on an ongoing basis. Some states and countries have mandatory laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph does not override those laws. UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US OF YOUR DESIRE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 'CANCELLATION' SECTION BELOW), YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORISE US TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE AMOUNT OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY APPLICABLE TAXES ON EACH PERIODIC RENEWAL DATE.",

            "We may decide to change the subscription fees, offerings, benefits or features at any time on a going-forward basis. If the subscription fees increase, the updated subscription fees will take effect at the start of the next billing period for your subscription or at a later date specified by us in our notice to you. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price or revised offerings by continuing to use or otherwise receive the benefits of the subscription service after the effective date of the change. You may reject the new subscription fee by cancelling your subscription prior to the effective date of the change.",

            "You may cancel your subscriptions at any time by going to the 'Billing' section of your Settings page. Cancellation will be effective at the end of the applicable subscription period during which you cancel. If you cancel your subscription, you will still have access to the subscription-based features for the remainder of time you have already paid for (unless we provide you with a refund or otherwise allow you to use the unused portion towards another service or subscription), but you will not receive a refund. Following cancellation, you'll continue to have access to premium features until the end of the then-current subscription period.",

If your payment is not successful (for example, if your payment method expired or has insufficient funds), we may attempt to re-run your payment method. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. We may also try to provide you notice of the failed payment and the opportunity to make a valid, on-time payment to us, but we are not obligated to do so. We may, in our sole discretion, choose not to cancel a subscription immediately for non-payment, in which case you will continue to be responsible for the fees due for the duration of the applicable subscription. In addition, if you fail to pay for a subscription, we may suspend your rights to use that premium service or we may change the type of privileges you have to a non-paid version of the service.",

            "Access to your subscription or rights to use any premium services or virtual goods purchased or otherwise available to you on our platform may also be terminated or suspended, in Adzsend's sole discretion, if you violate the Adzsend Terms of Service or other published policies. If your Adzsend account is terminated, suspended or you otherwise lose access to your account, you will not be entitled to a refund for any unused portion of your subscription or lost access to premium services.",

Necessary changes may include changes required to ensure the ongoing operation of our paid services, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to enhance existing features or to add additional features to the paid services, or to maintain the security of the services. If we make changes that will have a material negative impact on your use of the paid services or will remove existing paid features, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice.",

            "Additionally, we may decide to stop offering paid services, including subscriptions, at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control or to comply with a legal requirement. In this case, we'll cancel your subscription and refund the prorated portion of any prepaid subscription fee corresponding to the remaining unused term of the subscription.",
